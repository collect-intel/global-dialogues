When personalized recommendations become more and more accurate, can we still maintain true autonomy? When artificial intelligence systems influence our decisions everywhere, how can we ensure that our will is not manipulated?

The opening of ""psychological defense"" courses in schools is an interesting way to deal with it, but the deeper question is, how can we ensure that our thinking ability and judgment are not weakened while enjoying the convenience brought by artificial intelligence?
