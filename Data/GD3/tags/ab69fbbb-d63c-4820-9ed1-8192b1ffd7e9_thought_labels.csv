If AI only focuses on quantifiable indicators (such as economic growth or scientific breakthroughs), it may ignore those factors in human society that are difficult to measure but crucial, such as fairness, ethical responsibility, and cultural diversity. 

Although Scenario 1 may promote faster technological and economic development, if AI is over-automated and lacks human supervision, it may lead to unforeseen consequences, such as strengthening social injustice, sacrificing the environment, or harming individual rights. In contrast, Scenario 2, although it makes AI develop more slowly, ensures that humans dominate key decisions and reduces the risk of AI deviating from human values.
