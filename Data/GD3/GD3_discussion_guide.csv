"","Scenarios","","speak","The AI Death Doula / AI End-of-Life Guide
 In this future, AI systems improve end-of-life care through early detection of mental health concerns and comprehensive support. Analysis of digital patterns and health data helps identify suicide risk with 94% accuracy, enabling timely interventions that reduce attempts by 60%. For terminal patients, AI assistance provides continuous emotional support and helps with practical planning, with 40% now using these services to manage their final stages of life. Nursing home and healthcare workers report reduced emotional strain, with AI support leading to 70% less burnout among hospice staff. While families appreciate AI support, 35% report discomfort when AI systems make autonomous recommendations about pain management or life support timing that differ from family preferences. The result is a society that is less burdened by end-of-life suffering but more conflicted about who should make final decisions about death.","00:10"

"","Scenarios","","speak","The Age of AI Influencers 
AI has revolutionized marketing by helping people find products they truly need, with personalized recommendations saving the average family $2,000 annually on better-matched purchases. Smart advertising reduces waste by 40% by only showing relevant offers, while AI shopping assistants help consumers make more informed decisions by comparing options and highlighting hidden costs. However, people now face up to 4,000 AI influence attempts daily, with competing systems trying to shape their choices without them knowing. Schools teach ""mental defense"" classes to help students spot AI manipulation, but subtle AI campaigns can still shift public opinion by up to 15%. The result is a society that is less wasteful in its consumption but more constantly under siege from invisible persuasion attempts.","00:10"

"","Scenarios","","speak","To continue to help you think about these topics, consider these two different versions of the future:","00:10"
"","Scenarios","","speak","Scenario 1: In this future, AI companions become primary emotional partners for most humans, with personalized AIs providing almost perfect emotional attunement 24/7. These relationships surpass human connections in satisfaction and stability, leading to widespread preference for AI partnerships. While this eliminates loneliness and improves mental health, traditional human relationships decline sharply as people find them comparatively unpredictable and draining.  
Scenario 2: In this future, society actively restricts AI emotional capabilities. AI systems are deliberately designed to maintain clear boundaries, functioning purely as tools without simulating emotional connection. While this preserves the uniqueness of human relationships and emotional authenticity, people miss out on potential therapeutic and supportive benefits that more emotionally engaged AI could provide.","00:10"

"","Scenarios","","speak","Scenario 1: Global mega-corporations standardize AI workflows, with humans curating and overseeing specialized AI modules. Traditional employment and benefits remain, but individual autonomy decreases as workers depend on dominant corporate systems. The workforce divides into wealthy ""AI orchestrators"" with significant influence and a larger group performing AI-assisted tasks. This scenario preserves a familiar workplace culture but constrains human creativity and independence.
Scenario 2: In this future, advanced AI systems handle routine non-creative tasks—like accounting and logistics. Instead of single, full-time career paths, people form flexible project teams through online communities, collaborating on creative challenges before moving to new opportunities aligned with their interests. Income comes from donors, universal basic income, community resource sharing. In short, work consists of short, meaningful endeavors but without the stability of a traditional career.","00:10"

"","Scenarios","","speak","Scenario 1: In this future different cultural groups maintain distinct AI systems based on local values and traditions. Japanese AI embodies harmony, Maasai AI incorporates traditional decision-making, and Islamic AI follows Sharia principles. Richer and more established countries and communities tend to have more access than others. International technology use requires ""cultural translation layers"" that mediate between different AI systems, much like diplomatic protocols.
Scenario 2: In this future all AI systems operate on a single, carefully crafted ethical framework developed through global consensus. This universal AI system synthesizes diverse human wisdom - from scientific research to Indigenous knowledge to Eastern philosophy. Every person has equal access to AI that respects both universal principles and local contexts. This single unified framework enables unprecedented cooperation on global challenges.","00:10"

Scenario 2: The company changes internal decision-making to include much more input from all kinds of people with different points of view who are not experts in the space.
