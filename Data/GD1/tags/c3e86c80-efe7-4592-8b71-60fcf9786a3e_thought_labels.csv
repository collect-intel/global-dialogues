In Future E, people have established deep emotional connections with AI, and AI is not only a tool, but also a friend, partner, or even family member. For those who are lonely, such as the elderly or those with special needs, this AI partner can provide real emotional support and companionship. This relationship can greatly improve their quality of life and help them better cope with loneliness and mental health issues.

Of course, this close relationship may also bring some problems, such as AI may be used to manipulate people, or someone may rely too much on AI and ignore real interpersonal interactions. However, these problems can be solved by establishing appropriate supervision and design. For example, some rules can be formulated to prevent AI from being abused, or some functions can be designed to prevent users from becoming overly dependent on AI.

On the contrary, although the strict restrictions of Future F can prevent some negative effects, such as preventing AI from being abused, it also has its shortcomings.
