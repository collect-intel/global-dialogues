# Data Guide

## Overview

Global Dialogues is a recurring, cross-national survey program designed to collect public perspectives on AI. Each cadence involves an online, AI-moderated dialogue session (30-60 minutes) hosted on Remesh.ai. Participants, recruited through Prolific, answer standard poll questions and open-ended opinion questions, and vote on peer statements, generating quantitative evidence of agreement.

Some standard initial *Poll Single Select* questions are used to define participant *Segments*. These standard Segments primarily include:

-   Age groups (~10-year buckets)
-   Gender (Male/Female/Non-binary)
-   Religion
-   Country (also grouped into various regions and subregions)
-   Environment (Urban/Rural/Suburban)

Other *Poll Single Select* questions simply collect additional survey information. All Polls use pre-defined responses.

*Ask Opinion* questions pose an open-ended question. Participants respond with freeform text and are then prompted to vote 'agree' or 'disagree' on a random set of 5 other participants' responses. Segments are used to express the "agreement rate" â€“ the estimated percentage of participants in that Segment who agree with a particular *Ask Opinion* response based on the vote data.

*Ask Experience* questions are also open-ended but do not prompt participants to vote on others' responses.

Participants are guided through an experience designed to feel like a moderated "dialogue", led by a named moderator. Context is provided to prepare them for each set of questions. This context might not always be clear from the question text itself and may need to be referenced from the separate Dialogue Guide, which includes the full moderation prompts.

Global Dialogues were conducted in multiple languages (Arabic, English, Russian, Chinese, Hindi, French, Portuguese, Spanish), with questions translated accordingly. When participants responded to *Ask Opinion* questions, their answers were machine-translated into the voter's selected language for the subsequent voting phase. For transparency, the *Original Responses* are preserved as written, alongside a machine-translated *English Response* for easier analysis.

## Global Dialogues Indicators

Starting with `GD3`, *Global Dialogues Indicators* are recurring Poll questions that will be asked in every cadence (with minimal modification). These intend to capture a "global pulse" over time to capture changes in attitudes and establish baselines for subsequent questions in the rest of the dialogue. Nothing in the data files distinguishes Indicator questions, so these are outlined and categorized for easy reference in `INDICATOR_CODESHEET.csv`.

## Data Files

**Note:** All data files follow the naming convention `GD<N>_filename.csv` where `<N>` is the Global Dialogue number (e.g., GD3, GD4).

### **`GD<N>_discussion_guide.csv`**

This file outlines the structure and content of the dialogue as experienced by participants, in chronological order.

\* **Agreement Rate Definition:**
-   For *Poll* Questions: The percentage of participants who selected a specific response.
-   For *Ask Opinion* Questions: An estimated measure of the percentage of participants who indicated "Agree" with the given response (vs. "Disagree"). Due to the impracticality of all participants voting on every response, a prediction algorithm (~85% accuracy) imputes votes based on a limited sample (5 votes per participant per question).

### **`GD<N>_embeddings.json`**

This large JSON file contains semantic embeddings for questions and responses, enabling advanced analysis like thematic clustering and semantic similarity calculations. Due to its size (typically >500MB), this file is not stored in the Git repository and must be downloaded separately.

Structure:
- Contains question texts, response texts, and their corresponding embedding vectors
- Used by advanced analysis scripts like `thematic_ranking.py`
- Requires API key for regeneration if not available

### **Tag Data Files**

Starting with GD3, tagged categorizations of open-ended responses are collected. These appear in two directories:

#### **`tag_codes_raw/`**

Contains raw export files from the Remesh platform with timestamps. Multiple versions may exist for each question:
- `*_Tag_Categories.csv`: High-level category assignments for responses
- `*_Thought_Labels.csv`: Detailed labels for individual responses

#### **`tags/`** 

Contains processed tag files organized by Question ID after running `preprocess_tag_files.py`:
- `<question_id>_tag_categories.csv`: Category groupings for the question
- `<question_id>_thought_labels.csv`: Individual response labels
- `all_tag_categories.csv`: Consolidated categories across all questions
- `all_thought_labels.csv`: Consolidated labels across all responses

Tag file structure:

| Column          | Description                                                  |
