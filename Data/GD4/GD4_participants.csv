This difference is important to me because relationships with humans have the uncertainty, intimacy and possibility of growth that make a relationship real.

यह अंतर मेरे लिए इसलिए महत्वपूर्ण है क्योंकि इंसान के साथ संबंधों में अनिश्चितता, आत्मीयता और विकास की संभावना होती है, जो रिश्ते को असली बनाते हैं। AI के साथ रिश्ता भले ही सटीक और आरामदायक हो, पर उसमें वह स्वाभाविक जटिलता और सजीवता नहीं होती जो एक इंसानी रिश्ते को खास बनाती है।","--","If I were to design my ideal AI companion, I would want her to be a lover of old Hindi movies and songs.
